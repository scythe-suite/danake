# Introduction

The *‚àÇanake* component is part of the [scythe-suite](https://github.com/scythe-suite/) and allows remote, authenticated, and isolated execution of a development environment.

From the student point of view, *‚àÇanake* is web application:

* the authentication requires the student to upload a picture of her face, taken beside a photo ID; such picture will be obtained using the widely supported [MediaDevices](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices) Web API;

* the development environment is based on [code-server](https://github.com/cdr/code-server), a "version" of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) that runs in the browser.

The backend consists of a novel application handling the authentication (similar to [ùúè](https://github.com/mapio/tau)) and a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) *swarm* running a set of micro-services, accessible through a front facing [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) reverse proxy.
